# Simpson
This MATLAB program can conduct numerical integral for functions of one variable using Simpson's rule. You can adjust two parts of the program labeled by [1] and [2]. In [1], you can set the range of the integral (xmin and xmax) and the number of segments (N). In [2], you can choose any functions with one variable x only if there are no singularities.
